      "It has been reported that the topology of brain networks optimises wiring and maximise efficiency (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012). This optimisation has been regarded as the fruit of evolution, a quality that may have been acquired through millions of years of adaptive natural selection. The null hypotheses against which optimisation is judged -- random networks or regular lattices -- are, however, rather irrealistic. Brain networks are the result of natural developmental phenomena, the growth of dendritic trees and axons in a substrate that is itself undergoing massive growing. Newly generated neurones have been observed to send axons to subcortical structures since the earliest stages, well before reaching the cortical plate. Some of these connection may be pruned at later stages, but some of them will form the basic pattern of brain connections that will be still present in the adult. Early connections will be formed when the brain volume is just a few cm3, but will mature into the connections observed in the adult, when the brain volume will be more than 1,000 times larger. Producing a random graph topology or a regular lattice topology would require developmental processess incredibly complex."

      "Here we propose a simple model of brain network generation intended to serve as a more realistic null hypothesis. The model is based on just two very basic hypotheses: (1) the number of neurones increases through time, (2) the probability of two neurones forming connections is inversely proportional to their distance. As the brain model grows, short-distance connections formed among regions that were initially close, become long-distance connections. There will then be a link between the time of formation of a connection and its length: earlier connections will on average longer than the later ones.\n",

      "We start by analysing the topological properties of these graphs, their small-worldness, modularity, average short path length, their efficiency, and then we use them as null hypothesis to evaluate real structural and functional connectivity graphs from human neuroimaging data."

      "Brain networks do not show significantly different topological properties than those generated by our model. In population genetics, the two main forces driving evolution are selection and natural drift. Selection captures the adapatative modification of the phenotype, whereas drift captures the random effects due to environmental constraints such as distance, nanani, nanana. The current phenotype of a species is not only the result of adaptive selection, but more exactly the phenotype that has slip through the nets of adversity. Spandrels, Gould & Lewontin describe this nicely, use what you have at hand. Modern human brains have existed for some 130k years, however, the first traces of what we consider human culture, art, pottery, are much more recent, maybe less than 60k years. It is probable that for some 70k years, human had a modern brain topology but nature had yet to discover what it was good for."
